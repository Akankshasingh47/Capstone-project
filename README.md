# Capstone-project
The goal of this project is to analyse the given data on penguins and predict whether a particular penguin specie will appear at the most favourable point based on the physical attributes. The data was divided into 2 parts i.e. the training dataset and the testing dataset.
Models were developed on the training dataset and tested on testing dataset to find out the accuracy of each model based on the predicted values generated. Based on these models , we can determine how good a particular model is for the prediction .

conclusion
We will be using the same dataset through our discussions on classification with tree-methods (Decision Tree,Random Forests, Logistic Regression and  Naive Bayes) in order to compare performance metrics across these related models.
In the last we can conclude that
decision tree has the accuracy of 97%
logistic regression accuracy is of 100%
randomforest also has the accuracy of 100%
naive bayes has good accuracy of 98%

In all the cases the accuracies are quite high and reliable but the best are logistic regression and random forest in case of this dataset
